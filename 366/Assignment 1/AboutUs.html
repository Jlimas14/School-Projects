        <h1>Thank you for looking at our site</h1>
        <p>We are pretty new and havenâ€™t gotten many animals, but we make sure they are fed well, sleep well, and feel comfortable in the habitat that we give them.</p>
        <p>Our plan is to take care of more animals and our goal is to take animals who need a home or have lost their habitat from any form of disasters and give them a place.</p>
        <p>Here is our <a href="Animals.html">list of animals</a></p>

        <p>As a fairly new place, we are having a <a href="Fundraiser.html">Fundraiser</a> for those who are interested in supporting us.</p>
        <p>We have also been sponsered by <a href="https://www.peta.org/">PETA</a> for our goal of protecting animal rights</p>
