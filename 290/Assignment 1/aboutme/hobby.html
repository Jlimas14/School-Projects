    <h1>Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Playing games</h2>
    <p>One hobby that I have is playing games. While games are really pleasing, they tend to be looked down on because usually,
        people spend a lot of time on them, but gaming has its benefits, for example, games have been known to help with multi-tasking,
        and improve our mental flexibility. Some games are meant to be educational and there are games that aren't so helpful
        in that area.</p>

    <h2>Why I like my hobby</h2>
    <p>I enjoy playing games because they relax me and will distract me a little when times get tough. Many games expand my ways of 
        thinking or give me new ideas. Some games I will play just to listen to music and not think about what I am doing when playing. 
        Growing up with games has always made them feel nostalgic, so I don't plan to stop playing games anytime soon.</p>

    <h2>My issue with my hobby</h2>
    <p>The biggest issue with my hobby is that it can be a huge time-waster, and as I grow older I notice how much time I spend 
        playing games rather than using it for productivity. Having new ideas and alternate ways of thinking is wasted, if they 
        are not implemented and not being used. Overall though I still play games and enjoy them, but I have started trying to limit 
        myself to prevent playing excessively.</p>
    <h2>Current favorite game</h2>
    <p>Genshin impact is a game I have been playing recently and is currently my go-to game. The game has really soothing music 
        and there is a lot of depth even though the game is still in development. You can spend a good amount of time on the game
         in the beginning, but I noticed that when I play it I can limit myself more and how long I play. The game gives out daily 
         commissions and daily resin. I usually spend half my game time on these daily tasks. I spend about an hour each day playing 
         this game, but it's the only game I play. I'm not entirely sure if I just want to learn more about my future objectives 
         nowadays or if timing myself with free time helped me get a little more productive.</p>
