            <p>Starting from the beginning of my education, I started my education by being homeschooled. I ended up going to Mary Erye 
                elementary my last year of elementary. I went to Houck middle school for the whole three years. Afterward, I went to North 
                Salem high school for the end of my preliminary schooling. I entered Chemeketa Community College after high school. I stayed 
                at Chemeketa for about four years. Two years ago, I found what major I wanted to pursue after I took computer science.</p>

            </nav>
            <p>This is a quote that I find inspirational. I enjoy the idea of becoming better than you once were and trying to get rid of 
                your weakness. For example, as I grew older in school, I started to become a huge procrastinator. It worked out in high school, 
                but slowly as I go throughout college, I am learning that I can't keep going through school in the same way that I am used to. 
                Lately, I have been trying to get better at starting an assignment even if I don't understand it, but I still tend to fall back 
                to my habits. So my idea of pushing harder than yesterday is getting rid of my weaknesses and my bad habits.</p>
