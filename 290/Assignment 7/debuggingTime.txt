
Teacher input:
Put ===<%- students %>=== in the view somewhere. Does anything appear between the ==='s?

In the router, do a console.log with students before rending the view. Does anything show? Is it []?

In the virtual, print out studentArray before returning. 

If it is [] the find isn't working, Try doing a find without the equals - does it generate students?

If so, either "classRoom" is wrong, or this_.id is not working. Print out this._id and compare it to a full list of students. Are there some that have "classRoom: thatID"?

My thinking after;
classRoom and this._id is right, so it will have to be when adding classRoom to the student object
this means that the problem is in addData.js

Result:
After doing these steps, I found the issue was in addData, I put the wrong name into the studentRecords and the students ended up with a blank classRoom which resulted in giving them nothing. I couldn't figure it out because I forgot to use console.log and didn't notice it on the mongodb.
