          <h2>Playing games</h2>
          <p>
            One hobby that I have is playing games. While games are really
            pleasing, they tend to be looked down on because usually, people
            spend a lot of time on them, but gaming has its benefits, for
            example, games have been known to help with multi-tasking, and
            improve our mental flexibility. Some games are meant to be
            educational and there are games that aren't so helpful in that area.

          <h2>Why I like my hobby</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy playing games because they relax me and will distract me a
            little when times get tough. Many games expand my ways of thinking
            or give me new ideas. Some games I will play just to listen to music
            and not think about what I am doing when playing. Growing up with
            games has always made them feel nostalgic, so I don't plan to stop
            playing games anytime soon.

          <h2>My issue with my hobby</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest issue with my hobby is that it can be a huge
            time-waster, and as I grow older I notice how much time I spend
            playing games rather than using it for productivity. Having new
            ideas and alternate ways of thinking is wasted, if they are not
            implemented and not being used. Overall though I still play games
            and enjoy them, but I have started trying to limit myself to prevent
            playing excessively.

          <h2>Current favorite game</h2>
          <p>
            Genshin impact is a game I have been playing recently and is
            currently my go-to game. The game has really soothing music and
            there is a lot of depth even though the game is still in
            development. You can spend a good amount of time on the game in the
            beginning, but I noticed that when I play it I can limit myself more
            and how long I play. The game gives out daily commissions and daily
            resin. I usually spend half my game time on these daily tasks. I
            spend about an hour each day playing this game, but it's the only
            game I play. I'm not entirely sure if I just want to learn more
            about my future objectives nowadays or if timing myself with free
            time helped me get a little more productive.
