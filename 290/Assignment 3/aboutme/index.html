            Starting from the beginning of my education, I started my education
            by being homeschooled. I ended up going to Mary Erye elementary my
            last year of elementary. I went to Houck middle school for the whole
            three years. Afterward, I went to North Salem high school for the
            end of my preliminary schooling. I entered Chemeketa Community
            College after high school. I stayed at Chemeketa for about four
            years. Two years ago, I found what major I wanted to pursue after I
            took computer science.

            This is a quote that I find inspirational. I enjoy the idea of
            becoming better than you once were and trying to get rid of your
            weakness. For example, as I grew older in school, I started to
            become a huge procrastinator. It worked out in high school, but
            slowly as I go throughout college, I am learning that I can't keep
            going through school in the same way that I am used to. Lately, I
            have been trying to get better at starting an assignment even if I
            don't understand it, but I still tend to fall back to my habits. So
            my idea of pushing harder than yesterday is getting rid of my
            weaknesses and my bad habits.
